***Disclaimer: Me being me, I'll keep on editing this readme page as I'll gain more and more insights on foundational Reinforcement learning, Q learning and frozenlake is best way to start with foundational RL, hence the readers must expect this doc to be dynamic.***

I've demonstrated this using the Frozen-Lake environment, which is provided by [Open-AI GYM](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/)

## Reinforcement learning and Q-Learning:
